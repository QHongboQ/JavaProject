/**Problem Statement: The university bookstore has a Kilobyte Day sale every October 24
 * giving an 8 percent discount on all computer accessory purchases if the price is less than $128,
 * and a 16 percent discount if the price is at least $128.
 * Write a program that asks the cashier for the original price and then prints the discounted price.
 * Step 1 Decide upon the branching condition.
 * original price < 128?
 * Step 2 Give pseudocode for the work that needs to be done when the condition is true.
 * discounted price = 0.92 x original price
 * Step 3 Give pseudocode for the work (if any) that needs to be done when the condition is not true.
 * discounted price = 0.84 x original price
 * Step 4 Double-check relational operators.
 * Step 5 Remove duplication.
 * Step 6 Test both branches.
 * Step 7 Assemble the statement in Java.
